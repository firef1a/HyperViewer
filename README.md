# firemod
A client-side mod for viewing code on DiamondFire. This mod displays the block-based code as a text in a pythonic/java-ic way.

## Main features and How 2 use.
To open the menu, press Y, then, before you join a plot, click the power button in the top left corner to turn on the codeviewer and allow the mod to perform actions for you. Then join a plot and fly around near your code (within 4 blocks) and the mod will automatically grab the code and add it to your codeviewer menu.

You can delete specific code templates after you turn the codeviewer grabber off (power button), aswell as deleting all grabbed code, saving it as a file, and loading it from a file named "codeDump.json" in your <insert instance folder>/firemod folder.
